function HPZ_check_file_format_correctness (data)

% this function makes sure that the data matrix read from the file is in
% the required format.
% if it is not in the required format, it may lead either to crashing, or
% erroneous results, or both, therefore this function checks this ahead and
% crashes immediately, with an informative error to the user as what caused
% the problem and how to fix it.
