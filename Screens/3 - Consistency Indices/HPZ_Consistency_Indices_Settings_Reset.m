% but it can also run directly if you desire to reset all the settings.

% for detailed explanations about input/output variables that possess
% the same name and meaning in multiple functions (e.g. data, action_flag, 
% pref_class, etc.) see: HPZ_Variables_Documentation in the "Others" sub-folder
