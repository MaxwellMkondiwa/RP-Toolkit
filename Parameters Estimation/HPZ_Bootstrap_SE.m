% This function repeatedly picks randomly n observations out of the n 
% observations of the subject, with replacement. That means, that the common
% set of observations that will result will contain most observations, but
% not all of them.
% (for example: if we have 8 observations of the subject, we might take the
% set: {1,1,2,3,5,7,8,8} or the set: {2,3,3,3,5,6,6,7} and etc.)
% We then take this set of observations of the subject, and estimate the 
% subject's utility function parameters assuming these are the only 
% observations available.
% The function returns the average of the parameters, the maximal and
% minimal values of them, and the standard error. In fact, this function
% can return the whole distribution of the parameters' values.
% In the results files ("Choi at al. (2007) - Results" and "Halevy et al
% (2016) Part 1 - Results") we include descriptive statistics of the
% parameter frequencies in 1000 re-samplings of each individual data set in
% every reported recovery scheme. Potentially, we could have used these
% distributions to evaluate whether the restriction can be rejected.
% However, since we do not provide any proof that these re-samplings indeed
% recover confidence sets for the parameters, we merely interpret them as a
% measure for the sensitivity of the recovered parameters to extreme
% observations.
% The importance of this function is that it allows the user to see if there are 
% few/small number of observations that cause a significant change in the
% estimation, what the regular estimation (taking all observations) cannot
% emphasize. 
% one specific reason it is important is because if the DM made some mistakes in 
% choices, or changed his mind, or from any other reason, had a single or
% few exceptional choices, we might be interested to know that it might be
% the case and maybe the DM's preferences are somewhat different than the
% result that was received from estimating while accounting for all
% observations.

% for detailed explanations about input/output variables that possess
% the same name and meaning in multiple functions (e.g. data, action_flag, 
% pref_class, etc.) see: HPZ_Variables_Documentation in the "Others" sub-folder 



% NOTE: to make the code and the notes easier to read, we assume a
% significance level of 5% in variables names and in documentation.
