% we want to check the Criterion value for every pair of (beta,rho)
% such that beta=p-1 and rho=0, when p is an intermediate of two of the
% prices ratios (p>=1) that the DM was exposed to.
% We want to find the lower (hence better) criterion from these cases. 
% Note: we also check the intermediate between 1 and the lower price ratio
% (if the lower isn't 1); and we also check an "intermediate" between the
% highest ratio and Infinity, by taking arbitrarily a ratio slightly bigger
% than the highest ratio (currently e take: highest ratio + 1).
% Also note that in the case of CRRA, when beta > p-1 for every 
% obserbed p, the criterion does not depend on the value of rho at all
% (that is, rho doesn't have to be 0).
