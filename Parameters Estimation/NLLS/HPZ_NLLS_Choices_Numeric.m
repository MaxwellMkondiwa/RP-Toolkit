function [choice_matrix, param] = HPZ_NLLS_Choices_Numeric (param, prices, endowments, treatment, function_flag, asymmetric_flag, pref_class)

% This function finds and returns the optimal choice (a bundle) of the DM,
% given his/hers preferences, prices, and other things.
% In case of multiple optimal choices - it returns the optimal bundle that
% is closest to the observed bundle.

% The output is a matrix. The number of rows is the number of observations, 
% while the number of columns is the number of goods (currently 2).
% Each row is a vector of optimal choices (one quantity for each good).

% "param" is returned because it may change (be rounded) during the
% calculations

% for detailed explanations about input/output variables that possess
% the same name and meaning in multiple functions (e.g. data, action_flag, 
% pref_class, etc.) see: HPZ_Variables_Documentation in the "Others" sub-folder
