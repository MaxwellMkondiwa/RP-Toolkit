% Lion in the desert

% The function finds the money metric value (v*i(D,u)) for every
% observation, assuming the given functional form and the proposed parameters.
%
% For each observation:
% The function uses a "Lion in the desert" algorithm, that is - it performs  
% a binary search in which it starts in the middle (criterion = 0.5), and in
% every step it decides whether to go up (e.g. in the beginning: to 0.75),
% or down (e.g. 0.25). In the current version of the code, the algorithm 
% goes so for 40 times, reaching a precision of +-4.5 x 10^-13, or 
% +-0.00000000000045, which we consider good enough for our needs.
% The algorithm changes the endowment at each point; but since all the 
% other code files assume constant endowment equals to 1, it actually
% changes the prices to adjust the endowment. For example, if we want to
% check for endowment = 0.25, we just need to double prices by 4 (or divide
% them by 0.25). the variable "temp_price" is the one used for these
% adjustments.
