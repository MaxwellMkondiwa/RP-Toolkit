% subjects in the data.
% for more information about the bootstrap, see the documentation there.

% this function takes the single values that were produced by
% HPZ_Bootstrap_SE, and turns each of them to a vector of rows_out
% identicle copies of the original value.

% of the results and not only the optimal. in that case we show the
% bootstrap results near each of these results that relate to the same
% subject.
