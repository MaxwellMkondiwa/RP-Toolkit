% When calculating various Inconsistency Indices (e.g. Varian, Houtman-Maks), 
% the calculations can be performed separately for disjoint subsets of
% observations, then in the end aggregated together.
%
% Such distribution of the calculation problem to smaller problems, assists
% and improves running time in 2 aspects:
%   (1) if the complexity of number of iterations of the algorithm is
%       O(f(n)), and normally in complicated indices f is either polynomial
%       with a high degree or even exponential, reducing the size of n by
%       this distribution significantly reduces running time.
%   (2) the inner complexity of each iteration is smaller, since the sizes
%       of all matrices are smaller.
%   * Also any subset that has only 1 observation is a subset that does not
%     affect the index, therefore it requires no further calculations.
%
% In order to achieve all these great fits, this function finds the best
% possible distribution (distribution to smallest subsets), and returns
% the subsets.
%
% The distribution to subsets differs depending on the index and the
% calculation problem related to it, for example: 
% * in the case of the Varian Index, we would like to have disjoint subsets 
%   such that there is no cycle of strict-revealed-preferred relations that 
%   involves observation from different subsets.
% * in the case of the Houtman-Maks Index with 3 or more goods, we would 
%   like to have disjoint subsets such that there is no GARP-violating 
%   cycle that involves observation from different subsets.
% * in the case of the Houtman-Maks Index with 2 goods, we would like to 
%   have disjoint subsets such that there is no GARP-violating cycle of
%   length 2 that involves observation from different subsets.
% The parameters "relevant_RP" & "relevant_SRP" allows the distribution
% according to different types of cycles and relations.
