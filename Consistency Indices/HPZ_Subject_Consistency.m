% this function calculates all the currently implemented consistency and

% it may calculate only some of them), for a single subject.
% the WARP, GARP and SARP measures are implemented within the function
% itself, while the inconsistency indices (Afriat, Varian, Houtman-Maks) 
% are being calculated by calling other specific functions.

% the same name and meaning in multiple functions (e.g. data, action_flag, 
% pref_class, etc.) see: HPZ_Variables_Documentation in the "Others" sub-folder 

%% output variables :
% expenditure,DRP,SDRP,RP,SRP,WARP,GARP,SARP,FLAGS :
%   all these are not really needed, but are the result of intermediate
%   calculations, and are returned only because someone might want to use
%   them for some purpose.
% VIO_PAIRS,VIOLATIONS :
%   are each 3-length vectors, when the 1st element is for WARP, the 2nd is
%   for GARP, and the 3rd is for SARP.
%   they are measures of inconsistency with WARP/GARP/SARP, by counting
%   number of violations or number of pairs of choices involved in
%   violations.
% AFRIAT,VARIAN,Var_exact,HM,HM_exact :
%   inconsistency indices according to each of these methods.
%   VARIAN is a 3-length vector, since 3 aggregators are implemented:
%   (1) Max, (2) Mean, (3) Average Sum of Squares.
%   Var_exact and HM_exact tell the user whether the calculation was exact
%   or was it only an approximation, and what type of approximation.

%   results file

%      This will be used when we calculate DRP (direct revealed preference).
%   In other words, we take a conservative approach to SDRP, and on the
