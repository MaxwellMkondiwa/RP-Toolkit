function [HM, HM_raw, HM_raw_pseudo_residuals] = HPZ_Houtman_Maks_Two_Goods_Only (GARP_couples, approach_type)

% this function is, in fact, an implementation of an algorithm of minimum vertex cover 
% to see that, you may rename the variables as follows:
%   HM_raw -> size_mVC (size of minimum vertex cover)
%   HM -> percent_mVC (size of minimum vertex cover / number of vertices)
%   HM_raw_residuals -> is_in_mVC (a vector that says for each vertex if it is in any mVC, or not) 
%   HM_raw_pseudo_residuals -> if it is 1, we can say for sure that the vertex 
%                              is in some mVC, but if it is 0, we are not sure 
%   GARP_couples -> G (the graph as a matrix; (i,j)=1 iff there is an edge between vertices i and j) 

% WHEN FIRST CALLED (not inside the recursion), 
% approach_type should be equal 0
% (unless you are sure the graph contains no leaves)



% --- Explanation about the Algorithm ---
% The algorithm only looks for SOME minimum vertex cover, and not necessarily  
% all such covers. This aspect is what allows us to use Algorithm 2.
% --- Algorithm 1 ---
%   Divide the graph to its connected components,
%   and find the minimum vertex cover for each (then sum them up)
% --- Algorithm 2 ---
%   If there is a leaf in the graph, add the vertex connected to the leaf
%   to the on-build vertex cover, then drop the leaf and its connected
%   vertex and all their edges from the graph. Continue this until there
%   are no leaves, then pass the remaining graph to another algorithm that
%   will solve the rest (Algorithm 3).
% --- Algorithm 3 ---
%   Find a vertex with maximum degree in the graph, denote it by v.
%   Solve the minimum vertex cover for 2 options:
%   option I  : v is in the cover - then we drop v and its edges and solve
%              the remaining graph.
%   option II : v is not in the cover - then all the vertices connected to
%               it must be in the cover, so we drop v and all its connected
%               vertices and solve the remaining graph.
%   Finally, compare the results of the 2 options, and take the one that
%   achieved a smaller vertex cover.
% --- Combining the three Algorithms ---
%   in each iteration, we first use Algorithm 1 to divide the problem to a
%   few smaller problems (if possible), then we call either Algorithm 2 (if
%   in the previous iteration we used Algorithm 3) or Algorithm 3 (if
%   in the previous iteration we used Algorithm 2)
% --- The Importance of each of the three Algorithms ---
%   Algorithm 3 can solve the problem on its own, but it is not always
%   efficient enough, and it is exponential at worst.
%   Algorithm 2 gives a huge boost if there are leaves.
%   Algorithm 1 allows faster computation since the complexity inside 
%   each iteration is polynomial (of degree 2 or 3) in the number of observations.
