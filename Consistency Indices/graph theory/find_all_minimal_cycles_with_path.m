    % this function is a Matlab implementation of the NEXT STEP
    % algorithm from the paper (as of 25.04.19 - working paper): 
    % "Code Package for Revealed Preferences Analysis of Choices from Linear Budget Sets"  
    %
    % as we mention in one of the footnotes in the article, we also perform
    % BFS (Breadth First Search) in each iteration to check if there is
    % still some path that leads from the current node to the root.
    
    
    
    % initialization
    min_cycles_with_path = {};
    
    % Initial values: d is the last element in P; r is the first element in P.  
    %

    % and we want to complete the path to a cycle by finding a path
    % from current to root
    Root = Path(1);
    Current = Path(end);

    % 2. If OutG(d) is empty, terminate.

       return

    % 3. Else if r in OutG(d), Add P to MIN CYCLES and terminate.
    %
    % if Current points directly to Root, then we managed to close a
    % cycle, also there is no need to continue to the other vertices in
    % OutCurrent as any cycle they may lead to, this cycle we now found
    % will be its subcycle

    % them can lead the path to a minimal cycle
