% Input :
% per_observation_index - a vector of all the per-observation indices
% aggregation_method - a matlab function that is used to aggregate numbers
%   to a single index. e.g:
%   Avergae : @mean
%   Maximum : @max
%   AVGSSQ  : @(x) sqrt(meansqr(x))
% Output :
% in_sample_residuals - the in-sample residual for each of the
% observations, based on the specified aggregation method.

% This function is currently used only for the VARIAN index, which
% currently have 3 aggregators: Average, Minimum and AVGSSQ.



% the full index with all observations

    % this occurs when we calculate out-of-sample, and the recursive calls
    % somtimes lead to num_of_obs == 1
