% This function implements the same algorithm that is implemented in 
% "HPZ_Houtman_Maks_Cycles_Approach", but with some modifications, since
% this function can handle the case that dropping observation i has a
% weight of w_i, instead of being equal and constant (weight of 1) for all
% observations. 
% Since the weights are different, there is meaning in using different
% aggregates, so here we also check 3 different aggregates:
% maximum, average, and average sum of squares (AVGSSQ).
%
% The purpose of this function is currently solely as a mean to calculate
% the Varian Efficiency Index; we proved that any problem of calculating
% the Varian index can be translated to a problem of calculating the HM
% index with weights, just like this function does.

% this is for efficiency of finding minimal cycles algorithm.
% it is needed because the "find_all_minimal_cycles" function that will be
% called from "HPZ_Houtman_Maks_Weighted_Cycles_Approach" starts from the
% last vertex and goes backwords, and if old vertex A was splitted into A1,
% A2,...,Ak such that A1->A2->...->Ak, we want that A1 will be handled
% first by the "find_all_minimal_cycles" function, because then when we
% continue to Ai = {A2,...,Ak} after removing A1, the algorithm will 
% immediately recognize that there is no path back to Ai, since all paths 
% leading to Ai go through A1.
% if you use an implementation of "find_all_minimal_cycles" that starts
% from the 1st vertex and goes forward, you should delete the "FLIP" Parts
% I and II to regain efficiency.
